--------------------------

Instruction for installing calR
1) Extract calR_v3.1_precompile.tar.gz [tar -xvf calR_v3.1_precompile.tar.gz]


2) cd calR_v3.0_precompile 
   run CASA in the directory and on the ipython shell run :
   os.system('buildmytasks')
   [This should create multiple files in the directory including a 'gaincalR.py' file]


3) Open ~/.casa/init.py and add:
   [Note the init.py file may not exist and in which case, must be created] 
   
   gaincalR_path='/install/path'
   sys.path.append(gaincalR_path)
   execfile(gaincalR_path+'/mytasks.py')

   where /install/path is the path to the directory where the task was installed 
   (do retain the single quotes in that line)


4) Add the following line to your .bashrc script : 

   export CASALD_LIBRARY_PATH=/install/path/calRcore

  (do retain the /calRcore at the end of the installation path!)

5) Add the following line to ~/.casarc (you may need to create the file if it does not exist):
	 measures.directory: /path_to_casa_dir/casa-release-5.4.1-32.el7/data

 Replace path_to_casa_dir with where you have put casa.
